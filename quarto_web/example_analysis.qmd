# Introduction

## Background

In October 2023, James Hoffmann, a "world champion barista", and the coffee company Cometeer hosted the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" on YouTube [@youtube]. Participants tasted four different types of coffee ordered from Cometeer and completed a survey that gathered demographic information, coffee preferences and the ratings for the four coffee. Using the survey data collected during the taste test, this analysis aims to investigate the association between demographic factors and people's coffee preferences.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Due to the presence of missing data in the survey, we selected only the variables relevant to the subsequent analysis, which include age, gender, and the ratings for each type of coffee. Rows with NA values in these selected columns were removed, resulting in a total of 3,520 observations remaining for analysis.

```{r library and data load,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Data cleaning

# library
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Load the data 
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-05-14')
data <- tuesdata[["coffee_survey"]]

# only focus on the following variables
df <- data %>% 
  select(age, starts_with("coffee_a_"), starts_with("coffee_b_"),
         starts_with("coffee_c_"),starts_with("coffee_d_"),  gender)
df <- df %>% select(-ends_with("notes"))

# remove all rows with NA values
df <- na.omit(df)

df$gender[df$gender == "Other (please specify)"] <- "Other"
```

## Demographic characteristics of the study population

```{r, fig.dim=c(10, 7), fig.cap="Figure 1: Distribution of demographic characteristics of study population."}
# Create a pie chart to visualize distribution of age and gender 

# List of columns for pie charts
cols <- c("age", "gender")
title_labels <- list("age" = "Age",
                     "gender" = "Gender")
# List of colors of the pie chart
palettes <- list(
  age = "Set1",
  gender = "Set2")

# Create an empty list to store the plots
plot_list <- list()

# Loop through each column and create a pie chart
for (col in cols) {
  # Calculate frequencies
  data_summary <- df %>%
    count(!!sym(col)) %>%
    mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) # Calculate percentages

  # Create pie chart
  plot <- ggplot(data_summary, aes(x = "", y = perc, fill = !!sym(col))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
    coord_polar("y") +
    labs(title = paste(title_labels[[col]]), y = NULL, x = NULL) +
    theme_void() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = palettes[[col]]) +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = col))
  
  plot_list[[col]] <- plot
}

# Arrange the plots in a 2x2 grid 
grid.arrange(
  arrangeGrob(plot_list$age,  plot_list$gender, nrow = 1),  
  top = textGrob("Demographic characteristics of study population", gp = gpar(fontsize = 20, fontface = "bold")),
  bottom = textGrob("Most participants are 25-34 years old male.", gp = gpar(fontsize = 16))
)

```

The study population predominantly consists of young males. Given that the survey was conducted on YouTube, it is reasonable to expect that the majority of participants are younger individuals.

::: {.callout-note}
This demographic distribution is not representative of the overall American population, likely due to the sampling method employed in the study. Consequently, the results may not be generalizable to the whole US populations.

## Overview of coffee ratings


```{r, fig.dim=c(10, 7),warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2: Distribution of rating of bitterness, acidity and overall personal preferences across different coffee types"}
# Create frequency polygon plot to visually compare the rating of bitterness, acidity, and personal preference

# Gather the data into long format
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("coffee_"), 
               names_to = c("coffee_type", "attribute"), 
               names_pattern = "coffee_([a-d])_(.*)") %>%
  mutate(coffee_type = paste("Coffee", toupper(coffee_type)))

# Define color palette for each coffee type
coffee_colors <- c("Coffee A" = "#FF9999", "Coffee B" = "#66B2FF", 
                   "Coffee C" = "#99FF99", "Coffee D" = "#FFCC99")

# List of attributes to plot
attributes <- c("bitterness", "acidity", "personal_preference")

# Empty list to store the plots
plot_list <- list()

# Custom x-axis labels mapping
x_axis_labels <- c("bitterness" = "Bitterness", 
                   "acidity" = "Acidity", 
                   "personal_preference" = "Personal Preference")

# Loop through each attribute 
for (attr in attributes) {
  # Filter data for the current attribute
  data_attr <- df_long %>% filter(attribute == attr)
  
  # Create frequency polygon plot
  polygon_plot <- ggplot(data_attr, aes(x = value, color = coffee_type, fill = coffee_type)) +
    geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1, size = 1.2) + 
    xlim(c(1,5)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = coffee_colors) +
    labs(title = paste(x_axis_labels[attr]),
         x = x_axis_labels[attr], y = "Frequency") +
    guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Coffee type")) +  # Custom legend title
    theme_classic()
  
  # Append the plot to the list
  plot_list[[attr]] <- polygon_plot
}


grid.arrange(
  arrangeGrob(plot_list$bitterness, plot_list$acidity, 
             plot_list$personal_preference, nrow = 2),  
  top = textGrob("Ratings of bitterness, acidity and personal preferences", gp = gpar(fontsize = 20, fontface = "bold")),
  bottom = textGrob("Colors represent difference coffee type", gp = gpar(fontsize = 16))
)


```


::: {.column-margin}
Since the participant were asked to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-5, the ratings are considered as discrete variable. Therefore, a frequency polygon plot was used instead of a density plot to better represent the data and enhance aesthetics.
:::

On a scale of 1 to 5, most participants rated coffee B and C with a score of 3 for bitterness, while coffee A and D were perceived as less bitter. Coffee A and D also exhibited higher acidity levels compared to coffee B and C. Overall, coffee D was the most preferred among participants, followed closely by coffee A, with a comparable number of individuals favoring coffee B and C.

Interestingly, the distributions of bitterness and acidity scores for coffee A and D are highly similar, as are those for coffee B and C. While the overall preference distributions for coffee B and C are also alike, a greater number of participants rated coffee D as tasting better than coffee A.

::: {.callout-note}
According to the coffee company, coffee A is a light roasted single-estate coffee, coffee B is a medium roast blend, coffee C is a dark roast blend, and coffee D is a light roasted single-estate coffee with some fermented flavors. These results may indicate that participants struggled to differentiate between the medium roast (coffee B) and dark roast (coffee C) in terms of bitterness and acidity. Although the bitterness and acidity levels of coffee A and coffee D are also similar, survey participants expressed a greater preference for coffee D.

## Is there an association between age and coffee preference?

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 3: Box plots showing the distribution and summary statistics of personal coffee preferences across age groups for each coffee type."}
# Create box plots to visualize how rating might change with age 

# Filter data for only 'personal preference' ratings
df_preference <- df_long %>%
  filter(attribute == "personal_preference") %>%
  # Convert 'age' to a factor with a specific order
  mutate(age = factor(age, levels = c("<18 years old", "18-24 years old", 
                                      "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old", 
                                      "45-54 years old", "55-64 years old", 
                                      ">65 years old")))

# Create a box plot with rotated x-axis labels
ggplot(df_preference, aes(x = age, y = value, fill = coffee_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ coffee_type, ncol = 2) +  # Create a separate box plot for each coffee type
  labs(title = "Coffee Preference by Age Group Across Coffee Types",
       subtitle = "Examining if age are associated with personal preference for different coffee types",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Personal Preference Rating",
       fill = "Coffee Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```




Personal preference ratings for coffee vary slightly across different age groups. For instance, the distribution of preference ratings for coffee A among the age groups 18-24, 45-54, 55-64, and those over 65 is quite similar, with a median rating of 3. In these groups, there is an approximately equal number of individuals who enjoy or dislike the coffee. In contrast, the age groups under 18, as well as 25-34 and 35-44, have a median rating of 4, although the under-18 group exhibits a larger variance in ratings compared to the other two age groups.

In comparison, the median ratings for coffee B and C are consistent across all age groups. For coffee D, all age groups below 55 report a median rating of 4. However, older participants tend to have a lower preference, with the 45-54 age group giving a median rating of 3, while those in the 55-64 and over 65 age groups assign a median rating of 2.

::: {.callout-warning}
Since the ratings are discrete variables with only five possible values, there is a higher chance that the median ratings may be the same across different groups. To gain a clearer understanding of whether preference ratings differ among various age groups, we also calculated the average ratings.
:::


```{r, message=F,fig.cap="Table 1: Average coffee preference rating by coffee type and age group"}
# Calculate the average rating of personal preference for each age group and coffee type
average_ratings <- df_preference %>%
  group_by(age, coffee_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_preference = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Convert to wide format
average_ratings_wide <- average_ratings %>%
  mutate(avg_preference = round(avg_preference, 1)) %>%  # Round to 1 decimal
  pivot_wider(names_from = age, values_from = avg_preference)

# Display the table 
average_ratings_wide %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Age group", "<18", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", 
                             "45-54", "55-64", ">65"))
```

The results from the average preference ratings are consistent with the median ratings. For all coffee types, the average preference rating is approximately 3 across most age groups, with some exceptions: individuals over 55 tend to rate coffee D lower and those under 18 tend to rate coffee B lower, while people aged between 25-34 tend to rate coffee D higher.

## Is there an association between gender and coffee preference?

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 4: Heatmap of average preference rating of the four coffee type by gender.", fig.width=10}
# Create a heatmap to visualize how coffee preference changes with gender

# Calculate the average ratings 
df_preference_avg <- df_long %>%
  filter(attribute == "personal_preference") %>%
  group_by(gender, coffee_type) %>%
  summarize(avg_preference = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))

# Reorder the coffee types
df_preference_avg$coffee_type <- factor(df_preference_avg$coffee_type, 
                                        levels = c("Coffee D", "Coffee C", 
                                                   "Coffee B", "Coffee A"))

# Create the heatmap plot
ggplot(df_preference_avg, aes(x = gender, y = coffee_type, fill = avg_preference)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu", direction = -1, limits = c(2, 4), name = "Avg. Preference Rating") + 
  labs(title = "Average Coffee Preference by Gender and Coffee Type",
       subtitle = "Exploring the relationship between gender and coffee preference across different coffee types",
       x = "Gender", 
       y = "Coffee Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The average preference ratings differ slightly across gender categories for each type of coffee. Most gender groups exhibit a neutral preference for each coffee type, reflected in an average preference rating of 3, indicated in yellow. However, males tend to assign higher ratings to coffee A, while those who identified as "Other" generally rate coffee B and C lower. For coffee D, females tend to provide lower preference ratings, whereas the remaining gender groups tend to assign higher ratings.

# Summary

This analysis examined the relationships between demographic factors, specifically age and gender, and coffee preferences based on a survey conducted during the "Great American Coffee Taste Test." The results indicate that there is no strong association between age or gender and coffee preferences, except for coffee D, where younger participants and those identifying as male, as well as those choosing "other" or "prefer not to answer," tend to assign relatively higher preference ratings, contributing to a higher overall rating for this coffee. The average and median preference ratings for the four coffees across age and gender groups were close to 3, suggesting a neutral preference and an equal distribution of high and low ratings among participants in each demographic group. However, the study population is not representative of the broader U.S. population, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research could employ statistical models, such as linear regression, to quantify the associations between various demographic factors and coffee preferences and assess their statistical significance.
