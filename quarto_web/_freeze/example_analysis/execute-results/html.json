Participants tasted four different types of coffee ordered from Cometeer and completed a survey that gathered demographic information, coffee preferences and the ratings for the four coffee. Using the survey data collected during the taste test, this analysis aims to investigate the association between demographic factors and people's coffee preferences.\n\n![Coffee taste test](image2.png)\n\n\\[**Image Source**: [Cometeer James Hoffmann Taste Test Scoresheet](https://cometeer.com/pages/the-great-american-coffee-taste-test?srsltid=AfmBOoqU_dtUSsWODwHozAagupTV0IlXbaCbNKf9GpdEiPce9l_meOgK)\\]\n\n## Research Question\n\nIs there an association between demographic factors, such as age and gender, and individuals' coffee preferences?\n\n\n\n\n\n## Intended Audience\n\nThis analysis is aimed at coffee enthusiasts, industry stakeholders, and data science students.\n\n\n## Data Source and Data Dictionary\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is a part of the TidyTuesday initiative [@tidytuesday] and can be accessed on the [TidyTuesday GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-05-14).

Rows with NA values in these selected columns were removed, resulting in a total of 3,520 observations remaining for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data cleaning\n\n# library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n# Load the data \ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-05-14')\ndata <- tuesdata[[\"coffee_survey\"]]\n\n# only focus on the following variables\ndf <- data %>% \n  select(age, starts_with(\"coffee_a_\"), starts_with(\"coffee_b_\"),\n         starts_with(\"coffee_c_\"),starts_with(\"coffee_d_\"),  gender)\ndf <- df %>% select(-ends_with(\"notes\"))\n\n# remove all rows with NA values\ndf <- na.omit(df)\n\ndf$gender[df$gender == \"Other (please specify)\"] <- \"Other\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nThe R packages used in this analysis include `Tidyverse` [@tidyverse], `gridExtra` [@gridExtra], `grid` [@grid] and `RColorBrewer` [@RColorBrewer].\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nAlthough only age and gender are included in this analysis, the survey also collected additional demographic information, including education level, ethnicity, employment status, number of children, and political affiliation.\n:::\n\n## Demographic characteristics of the study population\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a pie chart to visualize distribution of age and gender \n\n# List of columns for pie charts\ncols <- c(\"age\", \"gender\")\ntitle_labels <- list(\"age\" = \"Age\",\n                     \"gender\" = \"Gender\")\n# List of colors of the pie chart\npalettes <- list(\n  age = \"Set1\",\n  gender = \"Set2\")\n\n# Create an empty list to store the plots\nplot_list <- list()\n\n# Loop through each column and create a pie chart\nfor (col in cols) {\n  # Calculate frequencies\n  data_summary <- df %>%\n    count(!!sym(col)) %>%\n    mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) # Calculate percentages\n\n  # Create pie chart\n  plot <- ggplot(data_summary, aes(x = \"\", y = perc, fill = !!sym(col))) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n    coord_polar(\"y\") +\n    labs(title = paste(title_labels[[col]]), y = NULL, x = NULL) +\n    theme_void() +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = palettes[[col]]) +\n    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = col))\n  \n  plot_list[[col]] <- plot\n}\n\n# Arrange the plots in a 2x2 grid \ngrid.arrange(\n  arrangeGrob(plot_list$age,  plot_list$gender, nrow = 1),  \n  top = textGrob(\"Demographic characteristics of study population\", gp = gpar(fontsize = 20, fontface = \"bold\")),\n  bottom = textGrob(\"Most participants are 25-34 years old male.\", gp = gpar(fontsize = 16))\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 1: Distribution of demographic characteristics of study population.](example_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe study population predominantly consists of young males.

Therefore, a frequency polygon plot was used instead of a density plot to better represent the data and enhance aesthetics.\n:::\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, most participants rated coffee B and C with a score of 3 for bitterness, while coffee A and D were perceived as less bitter. Coffee A and D also exhibited higher acidity levels compared to coffee B and C. Overall, coffee D was the most preferred among participants, followed closely by coffee A, with a comparable number of individuals favoring coffee B and C.\n\nInterestingly, the distributions of bitterness and acidity scores for coffee A and D are highly similar, as are those for coffee B and C. While the overall preference distributions for coffee B and C are also alike, a greater number of participants rated coffee D as tasting better than coffee A.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nAccording to the coffee company, coffee A is a light roasted single-estate coffee, coffee B is a medium roast blend, coffee C is a dark roast blend, and coffee D is a light roasted single-estate coffee with some fermented flavors. These results may indicate that participants struggled to differentiate between the medium roast (coffee B) and dark roast (coffee C) in terms of bitterness and acidity. Although the bitterness and acidity levels of coffee A and coffee D are also similar, survey participants expressed a greater preference for coffee D.\n:::\n\n## Is there an association between age and coffee preference?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create box plots to visualize how rating might change with age \n\n# Filter data for only 'personal preference' ratings\ndf_preference <- df_long %>%\n  filter(attribute == \"personal_preference\") %>%\n  # Convert 'age' to a factor with a specific order\n  mutate(age = factor(age, levels = c(\"<18 years old\", \"18-24 years old\", \n                                      \"25-34 years old\", \"35-44 years old\", \n                                      \"45-54 years old\", \"55-64 years old\", \n                                      \">65 years old\")))\n\n# Create a box plot with rotated x-axis labels\nggplot(df_preference, aes(x = age, y = value, fill = coffee_type)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ coffee_type, ncol = 2) +  # Create a separate box plot for each coffee type\n  labs(title = \"Coffee Preference by Age Group Across Coffee Types\",\n       subtitle = \"Examining if age are associated with personal preference for different coffee types\",\n       x = \"Age\",\n       y = \"Personal Preference Rating\",\n       fill = \"Coffee Type\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 3: Box plots showing the distribution and summary statistics of personal coffee preferences across age groups for each coffee type.](example_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal preference ratings for coffee vary slightly across different age groups. For instance, the distribution of preference ratings for coffee A among the age groups 18-24, 45-54, 55-64, and those over 65 is quite similar, with a median rating of 3. In these groups, there is an approximately equal number of individuals who enjoy or dislike the coffee. In contrast, the age groups under 18, as well as 25-34 and 35-44, have a median rating of 4, although the under-18 group exhibits a larger variance in ratings compared to the other two age groups.\n\nIn comparison, the median ratings for coffee B and C are consistent across all age groups. For coffee D, all age groups below 55 report a median rating of 4. However, older participants tend to have a lower preference, with the 45-54 age group giving a median rating of 3, while those in the 55-64 and over 65 age groups assign a median rating of 2.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nSince the ratings are discrete variables with only five possible values, there is a higher chance that the median ratings may be the same across different groups. To gain a clearer understanding of whether preference ratings differ among various age groups, we also calculated the average ratings.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the average rating of personal preference for each age group and coffee type\naverage_ratings <- df_preference %>%\n  group_by(age, coffee_type) %>%\n  summarize(avg_preference = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Convert to wide format\naverage_ratings_wide <- average_ratings %>%\n  mutate(avg_preference = round(avg_preference, 1)) %>%  # Round to 1 decimal\n  pivot_wider(names_from = age, values_from = avg_preference)\n\n# Display the table \naverage_ratings_wide %>%\n  knitr::kable(col.names = c(\"Age group\", \"<18\", \"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \n                             \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \">65\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Age group | <18| 18-24| 25-34| 35-44| 45-54| 55-64| >65|\n|:---------|---:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|---:|\n|Coffee A  | 3.1|   3.2|   3.4|   3.3|   3.2|   2.9| 3.3|\n|Coffee B  | 2.6|   3.2|   3.0|   3.1|   3.3|   3.3| 3.3|\n|Coffee C  | 2.9|   3.1|   3.0|   3.1|   3.2|   3.4| 3.2|\n|Coffee D  | 3.1|   3.4|   3.6|   3.4|   2.9|   2.5| 2.3|\n\n\n\nTable 1: Average coffee preference rating by coffee type and age group\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the average preference ratings are consistent with the median ratings. For all coffee types, the average preference rating is approximately 3 across most age groups, with some exceptions: individuals over 55 tend to rate coffee D lower and those under 18 tend to rate coffee B lower, while people aged between 25-34 tend to rate coffee D higher.\n\n## Is there an association between gender and coffee preference?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a heatmap to visualize how coffee preference changes with gender\n\n# Calculate the average ratings \ndf_preference_avg <- df_long %>%\n  filter(attribute == \"personal_preference\") %>%\n  group_by(gender, coffee_type) %>%\n  summarize(avg_preference = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Reorder the coffee types\ndf_preference_avg$coffee_type <- factor(df_preference_avg$coffee_type, \n                                        levels = c(\"Coffee D\", \"Coffee C\", \n                                                   \"Coffee B\", \"Coffee A\"))\n\n# Create the heatmap plot\nggplot(df_preference_avg, aes(x = gender, y = coffee_type, fill = avg_preference)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"RdYlBu\", direction = -1, limits = c(2, 4), name = \"Avg.

Most gender groups exhibit a neutral preference for each coffee type, reflected in an average preference rating of 3, indicated in yellow. However, males tend to assign higher ratings to coffee A, while those who identified as \"Other\" generally rate coffee B and C lower. For coffee D, females tend to provide lower preference ratings, whereas the remaining gender groups tend to assign higher ratings.\n\n# Summary\n\nThis analysis examined the relationships between demographic factors, specifically age and gender, and coffee preferences based on a survey conducted during the \"Great American Coffee Taste Test.\" The results indicate that there is no strong association between age or gender and coffee preferences, except for coffee D, where younger participants and those identifying as male, as well as those choosing \"other\" or \"prefer not to answer,\" tend to assign relatively higher preference ratings, contributing to a higher overall rating for this coffee. The average and median preference ratings for the four coffees across age and gender groups were close to 3, suggesting a neutral preference and an equal distribution of high and low ratings among participants in each demographic group. However, the study population is not representative of the broader U.S. population, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research could employ statistical models, such as linear regression, to quantify the associations between various demographic factors and coffee preferences and assess their statistical significance.\n\n\n\n# Fuctions\n\ndplyr: select, ends_with, starts_with, mutate, filter\n\ntidyr: pivot_wider, pivot_longer\n\nggplot: geom_bar, geom_freqpoly, geom_boxplot\n",
