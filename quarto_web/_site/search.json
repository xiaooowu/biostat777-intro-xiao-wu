Therefore, a frequency polygon plot was used instead of a density plot to better represent the data and enhance aesthetics.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, most participants rated coffee B and C with a score of 3 for bitterness, while coffee A and D were perceived as less bitter. Coffee A and D also exhibited higher acidity levels compared to coffee B and C. Overall, coffee D was the most preferred among participants, followed closely by coffee A, with a comparable number of individuals favoring coffee B and C.\nInterestingly, the distributions of bitterness and acidity scores for coffee A and D are highly similar, as are those for coffee B and C. While the overall preference distributions for coffee B and C are also alike, a greater number of participants rated coffee D as tasting better than coffee A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAccording to the coffee company, coffee A is a light roasted single-estate coffee, coffee B is a medium roast blend, coffee C is a dark roast blend, and coffee D is a light roasted single-estate coffee with some fermented flavors. These results may indicate that participants struggled to differentiate between the medium roast (coffee B) and dark roast (coffee C) in terms of bitterness and acidity. Although the bitterness and acidity levels of coffee A and coffee D are also similar, survey participants expressed a greater preference for coffee D."

For instance, the distribution of preference ratings for coffee A among the age groups 18-24, 45-54, 55-64, and those over 65 is quite similar, with a median rating of 3. In these groups, there is an approximately equal number of individuals who enjoy or dislike the coffee. In contrast, the age groups under 18, as well as 25-34 and 35-44, have a median rating of 4, although the under-18 group exhibits a larger variance in ratings compared to the other two age groups.\nIn comparison, the median ratings for coffee B and C are consistent across all age groups. For coffee D, all age groups below 55 report a median rating of 4. However, older participants tend to have a lower preference, with the 45-54 age group giving a median rating of 3, while those in the 55-64 and over 65 age groups assign a median rating of 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSince the ratings are discrete variables with only five possible values, there is a higher chance that the median ratings may be the same across different groups. To gain a clearer understanding of whether preference ratings differ among various age groups, we also calculated the average ratings.\n\n\n\n# Calculate the average rating of personal preference for each age group and coffee type\naverage_ratings &lt;- df_preference %&gt;%\n  group_by(age, coffee_type) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_preference = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Convert to wide format\naverage_ratings_wide &lt;- average_ratings %&gt;%\n  mutate(avg_preference = round(avg_preference, 1)) %&gt;%  # Round to 1 decimal\n  pivot_wider(names_from = age, values_from = avg_preference)\n\n# Display the table \naverage_ratings_wide %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable(col.names = c(\"Age group\", \"&lt;18\", \"18-24\", \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \n                             \"45-54\", \"55-64\", \"&gt;65\"))\n\n\n\n\nAge group\n&lt;18\n18-24\n25-34\n35-44\n45-54\n55-64\n&gt;65\n\n\n\n\nCoffee A\n3.1\n3.2\n3.4\n3.3\n3.2\n2.9\n3.3\n\n\nCoffee B\n2.6\n3.2\n3.0\n3.1\n3.3\n3.3\n3.3\n\n\nCoffee C\n2.9\n3.1\n3.0\n3.1\n3.2\n3.4\n3.2\n\n\nCoffee D\n3.1\n3.4\n3.6\n3.4\n2.9\n2.5\n2.3\n\n\n\nTable 1: Average coffee preference rating by coffee type and age group\n\n\nThe results from the average preference ratings are consistent with the median ratings. For all coffee types, the average preference rating is approximately 3 across most age groups, with some exceptions: individuals over 55 tend to rate coffee D lower and those under 18 tend to rate coffee B lower, while people aged between 25-34 tend to rate coffee D higher."

However, males tend to assign higher ratings to coffee A, while those who identified as “Other” generally rate coffee B and C lower. For coffee D, females tend to provide lower preference ratings, whereas the remaining gender groups tend to assign higher ratings."
